Honey And Mumford Learning Styles Questionnaire
Learning Styles Questionnaire
This questionnaire is designed to find out your preferred learning style(s). Over the years you have probably developed learning "habits" that help you benefit more from some experiences than from others. Since you are probably unaware of this, this questionnaire will help you pinpoint your learning preferences so that you are in a better position to select learning experiences that suit your style and having a greater understanding of those that suit the style of others.
This is an internationally proven tool designed by Peter Honey and Alan Mumford.
There is no time limit to this questionnaire. It will probably take you 10-15 minutes. The accuracy of the results depends on how honest you can be. There are no right or wrong answers.
If you agree more than you disagree with a statement put a tick by it.
If you disagree more than you agree put a cross by it.
Be sure to mark each item with either a tick or cross.
