Key Elements of the System (ForeSITE)
🎯 Objective
To develop and evaluate an Adaptive Learning System (ALS) that:

Personalizes learning using the Honey and Mumford Learning Styles Model.

Accurately identifies learner styles via Hard Majority Voting (HMV) ensemble method.

Forms collaborative groups using K-Means Clustering for improved engagement and learning outcomes.

🧠 Core Components
Honey & Mumford Learning Styles

Classifies learners as Activists, Reflectors, Theorists, or Pragmatists.

Supports experiential, varied, and style-specific learning activities.

Hard Majority Voting (HMV)

Ensemble classification using:

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Support Vector Machines

Bayesian Networks

Enhances the accuracy of learning style prediction by combining model outputs.

K-Means Clustering

Groups learners based on style and profile similarities.

Enables effective collaborative learning groups.

The Futures Toolkit (UK Government Office for Science)

Serves as the content foundation.

Provides structured modules (e.g., scenario planning, horizon scanning).

💡 System Design & Features
Learner-Centered Design

Identifies dominant learning styles via a questionnaire.

Adjusts course content accordingly.

Role-Based Access

Different dashboards for Students, Faculty, and Admins.

Progress & Certification

Learners must achieve 75% in modules to progress.

Certificate granted upon passing assessment (min. 3 points).

📈 Evaluation Approach
450 participants from PUP (15 colleges).

Stratified random sampling.

Two groups:

Experimental (with collaboration features)

Control (without collaboration)

Outcome Metrics:

Post-test performance

Engagement and collaborative task performance

📊 Benefits
Technical

Accurate, personalized, and adaptive learning paths.

Social

Inclusive education for varied learner types.

Environmental

Reduced paper use and infrastructure footprint via digital delivery.

⚠️ Limitations
Doesn’t include variables like:

Gender, socioeconomic status, prior Futures Thinking knowledge.

Short study duration.

Certification is only awarded after faculty evaluation.
